    "Yes ‚Äî I get exactly what you're saying, and you're **explaining it very clearly**. Here's the bottom line:\n",

    "### ‚úÖ What You Want:\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to build a chatbot (or backend function) that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses **OpenAI models** (like GPT-4) to answer questions.\n",
    "* **Automatically performs a real-time web search** when a user question requires up-to-date info.\n",
    "* Returns **current answers**, not just based on the model‚Äôs training cutoff (like ChatGPT does when it uses browsing).\n",
    "\n",
    "You're **not** looking to build a browser or search engine ‚Äî just want your AI assistant to *augment* itself with real-time knowledge when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùå What OpenAI API Does Not Do Out of the Box:\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI's API **does not** have real-time search or browsing built in.\n",
    "Even GPT-4 with tools (like browsing or code interpreter) only works *inside ChatGPT Pro*, not in the API directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ How You Can Achieve What You Want:\n",
    "\n",
    "You **can** build this functionality by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Use a Search API (like Bing or Brave)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This lets you send user queries to the internet and get fresh results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Send Search Results to GPT**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use your OpenAI model (GPT-4 or 3.5) to summarize, interpret, or answer based on those results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Control When to Search**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Always search\n",
    "* Only search for certain keywords\n",
    "* Use GPT itself to **decide if a search is needed** (meta-reasoning!)\n",
    "\n",

    "### üß† Example Logic in Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. User asks a question\n",
    "user_question = \"What is the best Microsoft certification as of now?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Ask GPT if it needs to search the web\n",
    "gpt_response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n",
    "    model=\"gpt-4\",\n",
    "    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"Does this question require live web search? '{user_question}'\"}]\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "if \"yes\" in gpt_response['choices'][0]['message']['content'].lower():\n",
    "    # 3. If yes, use Bing API\n",
    "    search_snippets = bing_search(user_question)\n",
    "    # 4. Send results back to GPT for summarization\n",
    "    final_answer = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n",
    "        model=\"gpt-4\",\n",
    "        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"Summarize the current answer to: {user_question}\\n\\n{search_snippets}\"}]\n",
    "    )\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # 5. If not, just use GPT normally\n",
    "    final_answer = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n",
    "        model=\"gpt-4\",\n",
    "        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_question}]\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives you **ChatGPT-like behavior** ‚Äî just in your own app.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° Optional Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use caching to avoid repeated searches.\n",
    "* Use other sources (e.g. Google News API, Reddit, Twitter).\n",
    "* Add fallback behavior if Bing API quota is exceeded.\n",
